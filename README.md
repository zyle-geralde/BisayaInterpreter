TO DO:
arithmetic (Done in declaration, go to assignment operation)
relational arithmetic(<= >=)
Logical expressions
AND OR etc.


fix later:
rearding the & and $. when placed in a character or string should be treated as a concatination or nextline
variable declaration should handle identifiers. Currently, it will return an error if declared with identifier

Note - Go to Bisaya++copy.js

DONE:
variable declaration
variable initialization
